The purpose of this algorithm is to find the roots of complicated functions.
INPUTS: - The function being evaluated
- A lower and upper guess of the root, the desired relative error and iterations
OUTPUTS: - The estimate of the roots location
-The aproximate relative error and the amount of iterations
Limitations to this algorithm is the way the function is inputed as well as errors when calling on the function.
