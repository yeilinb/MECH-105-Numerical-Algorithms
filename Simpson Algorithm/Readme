Simpson 1/3 rule is used to find the integral numerically using data. In certain situations the trapezoidal rule may also be implemented in this algorithm.
Inputs:-function values at x and an x-vector SIDENOTE~ x and y must be same length
Outputs: an estimation of the integral with the given data
Some limitations is that if the data has extremely small numbers, subtraction cancellation errors can occur.
