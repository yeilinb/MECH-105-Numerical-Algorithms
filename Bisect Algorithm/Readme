This algorithm uses the bisection method to find the roots of a function.
INPUTS: -name of function -lower and upper guesses -desired relative error (default = 0.0001%)
-maximum allowable iterations (default = 50) -additional parameters used by func
OUTPUTS: -real root -function value at root -approximate relative error (%) 
-number of iterations
The bisection method is a braketing method that looks for sign changes in continuous functions.
